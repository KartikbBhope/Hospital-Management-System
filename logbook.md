**Project Title: Hospital Management System
Semester: VI (2024-25)**

**1. Introduction**

Dates: 01/03/2025 to 15/03/2025

Problem Statement:Many hospitals still rely on manual systems for managing patient data, appointments, billing, and staff activities, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and errors. There is a clear need for a centralized, secure, and user-friendly system that can automate hospital operations.

Objectives:

Develop a web-based hospital management system.

Enable modules for patient registration, doctor management, appointments, billing, and report generation.

Create an admin panel for centralized control.

Ensure secure login and role-based access control.

Applications:

Small to medium-sized hospitals and clinics.

Diagnostic centers.

Educational institutes for demonstration.

Health tech startups.

**2. Literature Survey**

Dates: 17/03/2025 to 25/03/2025

Background:With digitalization trends, hospitals are moving toward smart, IT-enabled systems. A hospital management system enhances efficiency, reduces paperwork, and improves service quality.

Existing Systems:

Manual systems (register books, spreadsheets).

Proprietary hospital management software (expensive and complex).

Open-source platforms (often lack customizability).

Research References:

Sinha, “Hospital Information Systems,” 2019.

WHO eHealth Reports.

Existing PHP-MySQL open-source projects analyzed.

**3. Methodology**

Dates: 26/03/2025 to 05/04/2025

Hardware and Software Requirements:

System: XAMPP (Apache + MySQL + PHP).

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend).

PHP (Backend).

MySQL (Database).

System Design:Block Diagram:User Login → Dashboard → Module Access (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Appointment) → Database CRUD → Report Generation

Algorithm:

User authentication and role assignment.

Record creation (patients, doctors, appointments).

Data validation and update operations.

Report generation and export.

**4. Implementation Details**

Dates: 07/04/2025 to 20/04/2025

Module 1: User Authentication

Admin, Doctor, Receptionist roles.

Secure login with session tracking.

Module 2: Patient & Doctor Management

Add/edit/delete/search patient and doctor records.

Module 3: Appointment Scheduling & Billing

Real-time booking system.

Bill generation and invoice module.

Module 4: Report Generation

Export reports in printable formats.

Dashboard with analytics.

Testing:

Unit testing for each module.

End-to-end integration checks.

**5. Results**

Dates: 22/04/2025 to 26/04/2025

Dataset:

Simulated records for patients, staff, and appointments.

Performance Metrics:

System response time.

Accuracy of CRUD operations.

User feedback on interface usability.

Testing Results:

All modules tested and verified.

Minor UI issues addressed.

Successfully deployed on localhost using XAMPP.

**6. Conclusion**

Built a fully functional hospital management system using PHP and MySQL.

Covered core functions: registration, appointments, billing, and reports.

Interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate.

Future plans include cloud deployment and advanced features (e.g., e-prescription, SMS reminders).
